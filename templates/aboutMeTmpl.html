My name is Lysa Webb and I’m a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC). I’ve been in private practice for a
            few years but have been doing therapy in various environments for over 15 years. I earned my Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology, as well as a degree in Human Development, at the University of Utah, then spent several years working in residential
            settings. I went back to school to obtain my Master of Arts Degree in Counseling Psychology at Lewis and Clark College.

            Following graduation I went back to work in a child and adolescent residential center. After several years in residential work I shifted my focus to community mental health, doing crisis intervention for individuals in the community. I have experience
            working with all age groups affected by various mental illnesses ranging from depression to schizophrenia, using strength based concepts and individualized treatment plans to bring out the best in my clients. I specialize in working with young
            children ages two and up utilizing play therapy. As Plato stated, “You learn more about a person in an hour of play than in a year of conversation.”

I did take part in the Portland
            Marathon…once! I also enjoy playing basketball. Traveling the world to see rare and exotic locales is one of my favorite activities. My favorite place so far is Prague, Czech Republic, but
            my dream vacation would be to Australia!
